rose rose-rust
***Non-chemical control***
1. Prune out spring infections as soon as they are detected, to prevent the spread of spring spores
2. Collect and destroy fallen leaves in autumn to reduce the number of overwintering resting spores
3. If infections are persistently troublesome, it may be that the cultivar concerned is unusually susceptible, so consider replacing it with a different one
***Chemical control***
Use:
1. Bayer Fungus Fighter Concentrate
2. Bayer Fungus Fighter Plus
3. Scotts Fungus Clear Ultra 
4. Scotts Fungus Clear Ultra Gun

rose metallic-flea-beetles
***Non-chemical control***
1. Light infestations of the flea beetle can be tolerated as 
small amounts of leaf loss will not affect the vigour or overall
appearance of the plant.
2. Hand removal of the adults and larvae can help reduce infestation levels.
***Chemical control***
Use:
1. lambda-cyhalothrin (e.g. Westland Resolva Bug Killer)
2. deltamethrin (e.g. Bayer Sprayday Greenfly Killer)
3. Organic insecticides containing natural pyrethrins 
(e.g. Bug Clear Gun for Fruit and Defenders Bug Killer)
*Note: Plants in flower should not be sprayed due to the danger to pollinating insects.

rose two-spotted-mites
***Non-chemical control***
1. Try a high pressure hosing in the early morning - three days in a row.
2. Hosing plants mid-season to remove dust on the leaves helps too.
3. Use a handheld vacuum cleaner  to vacuum the leaves. 
After vacuuming, tip the contents immediately into a
plastic bag and place in the freezer for a few hours.
4. Pruning affected plants and removing infested leaves will reduce pest numbers.
5. Try to control weeds that harbour the pest such as plantains, black nightshade and marshmallow.
6. Keep your plants healthy by feeding, mulching and watering.
***Chemical control***
Use:
1. Potassium soap sprays such as Natrasoap
2. A horticultural oil such as Eco-Oil
3. 2% rosemary oil solution can kill the mites, without harming the beneficial predatory mite.
4. Wettable sulphur or dusting sulphur can only be used in cool weather,
or it will cause leaf burn. 
* You should avoid using an oil product for at least a month after
applying sulphur because in combination it can cause phytotoxic
problems for plants.

banana rhizome-rot
***Non-chemical control***
1. Provide better drainage
2. Avoid furrow irrigation and follow basin irrigation
3. Use disease free planting material
4. Remove Heliconia spp. and weeds from the field and nearby area
5. Adopt crop rotation involving non-host crops for 12 months
6. Leave soil fallow for 6 months, especially in summer
***Chemical control***
1. Drench soil with antibiotics like Streptomycin / Streptocycline 500ppm (500mg/L) 
2. Before planting, treat suckers with 0.4% copper oxychloride (4g/L) 30 minutes
3. Disinfect the irrigation water with 0.1% bleaching powder (1g/L) solution
4. Drench soil with 1% Bordeaux mixture or 0.4% copper oxychloride (4g/L)

banana banana-mosaic
Note: Banana Mosaic is a virus, and viral diseases cannot be cured
***Non-chemical control***
1. Eradicate and destroy all infected plants including suckers along with roots
2. Do not take suckers from affected fields
3. Use disease free suckers for planting. Use tissue culture plants and certified, disease free suckers
4. Observe strict quarantine regulations in disease free areas
5. Avoid growing leguminous and cucurbitaceous vegetables as intercrop
6. Before planting, spread lemon grass in the pits
***Chemical control***
7. Apply 25 g Phorate 10G or 20g Carbofuran 3G, 20 days after planting around the rhizomes in soil
8. Apply 12.5 g Phorate 10G or 10g Carbofuran 3G per plant in the leaf axils or
25 g Phorate 10G or 20g Carbofuran 3G per plant in the soil at 2 ½ months and 5 ½ months after planting.

banana banana-aphid
***Non-chemical control***
1. Inspect alternate hosts for aphids and eliminate them.
2. Control ants if possible and lawful; ants aggressively protect aphids from natural enemies.
Boric acid baits can work on organic farms.
3. Destroy wild bananas in the area.
4. Control weeds around bananas.
5. Diversify the banana farm by growing a range of different plants or crops
6. Keep banana mats pruned of all unwanted suckers.
***Chemical control***
Use:
1. Diazinon
2. Imidacloprid
3. Horticultural soaps and oils and dish washing detergents and water
ENDGROUP
banana banana-weevil
***Non-chemical control***
1. Use clean planting material (tissue culture) for planting. 
Weevils spread from field to field through infested plants.
2. At harvest cut pseudo stems as high as possible. 
Pseudo stems serve as food and refuge to weevils.
3. Accelerate the destruction of harvest residues or fallen plants
by cutting them into small pieces and prevent them from
becoming a support for weevils.
4. Use pheromone traps to capture weevils.
***Chemical control***
Use:
1. Nemathorin ® 10G (fosthiazate) at a dose of 20 g of commercial
product per plant.

cabbage downy-mildew
***Non-chemical control***
1. Pick off and dispose of (by burial, burning or consigning to the council green waste) 
affected leaves as soon as symptoms are seen
2. Remove and destroy severely affected plants
3. Avoid dense planting and control weeds, so that
there is good air circulation around the plants
4. In glasshouses, try to avoid prolonged leaf wetness or periods of high humidity
5. Avoid watering plants in the evening, as this can lead to high humidity or leaf wetness
that persists throughout the night.
6. Water early in the morning so that leaf surfaces dry out rapidly
7. To avoid infection from soil-borne resting spores, practice crop rotation for 
vegetables, and avoid re-planting with the same host for at least a year where an ornamental
plant has been affected
***Chemical control***
There are no fungicides available to amateur gardeners for use against downy mildews.
ENDGROUP
cabbage white-rust
***Non-chemical control***
1. Quarantine affected plants
2. Use good quality seed, long crop rotations, and remove debris after harvest.  
3. Irrigate for short periods early in the day, use wide row spacing, and plant in the
direction of prevailing winds so leaves dry rapidly.
4. Maintain appropriate crop nutrition (particularly adequate potassium and 
phosphorus) to reduce susceptibility of plants to the disease.
5. Remove crop debris (capable of harbouring oospores), and rotate with non-brassica crops for at least 3 years.
6. Grow resistant varieties.
***Chemical control***
1. Alternate protectant products (e.g., copper, mancozeb) with systemic products (e.g.,
metalaxyl, phosphorus acid), to prevent the development of resistant strains of the oomycete.

cabbage slugs-and-snails
***Non-chemical control***
